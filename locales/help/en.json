  "helpQuickStartContent": "Follow these steps to create a working font in minutes:\n\n* **1. Pick a Script:** Select your language from the home screen.\n* **2. Power Search:** Use **Ctrl+K** to open the **Command Palette**. Search for any character by name (e.g., 'ka') or hex code (e.g., '0B85') to open it instantly.\n* **3. Draw Your Shape:** Use the **Pen** for smooth curves or the **Calligraphy** tool for a traditional look.\n* **4. Positioning:** If your script has vowel signs, go to the **Positioning** workspace to align marks with base characters.\n* **5. Test & Export:** Click the **Test** (flask) icon to type with your font instantly. When ready, click **Export Font** to download your OTF file.",
  "helpDrawingTitle": "Drawing Workspace",
  "helpDrawingContent": "The Drawing workspace is where you design your character outlines. \n\n**1. Glyph Construction & Metadata:**\n* **Linked Glyphs (Live):** These characters combine other glyphs (e.g., `k` + `i`). They update automatically. Use the **Unlink** (broken chain) button to edit paths individually.\n* **Properties Panel:** Click the sliders icon to edit **LSB/RSB** (side bearings). For combining marks, set the class to **Mark** and check **Non-spacing** to ensure they have 0 advance width in the font.\n\n**2. Professional Drawing Tools:**\n* **Slice Tool:** Drag a line across any shape to split it into two independent segments. Slicing a **closed shape** (like a circle) turns it into two **open paths**.\n* **Calligraphy Pen:** Simulates a broad-nib pen. Cycle through 15°, 30°, and 45° angles by clicking the tool icon again.\n* **Edit Points:** Reveals anchor points. Double-click a line to add a point; double-click a point to delete it.\n\n**3. Contextual Toolbar:**\n* When paths are selected, a floating toolbar appears. You can perform **Numeric Transforms** (typing exact rotation or scale) and **Live Mirroring** (Flip X/Y) here for surgical precision.\n\n**4. Smart Grid Filters & Batch Mode:**\n* **Filters:** Use the 'Filter' menu in the header to show only **Incomplete** glyphs or view the whole font as a **Flat List**.\n* **Batch Mode:** Click the **Select** (stack) icon to select multiple glyphs. Use the action bar to **Bulk Transform** or unify **Metrics** across your selection.",
  "helpGeometryTitle": "Geometry & Bezier Curves",
  "helpGeometryContent": "Aksharajanani uses vector paths to define glyphs. Switching to the **Edit Points** tool allows for granular manipulation:\n\n* **Anchor Points:** The red squares that define the start and end of a segment.\n* **Control Handles:** The yellow handles connected to anchors. Drag these to adjust the **tension** and direction of the curve. Longer handles create more dramatic curves.\n* **Path Types:** The editor distinguishes between `pen` (freehand) and `outline` (SVG) paths. `outline` paths are always closed loops, ideal for shapes with counters (holes).",
  "helpPositioningTitle": "Positioning & Smart Classes",
  "helpPositioningContent": "This workspace handles how marks (like vowel signs) attach to base consonants.\n\n**1. Class Synchronization:**\n* Characters are often grouped into **Attachment Classes**. Positioning a mark on a **Class Representative** (marked with a crown) will automatically propagate that position to all other characters in that class. \n* **Dual-Context Switching:** If a pair falls into both a 'Base Class' and a 'Mark Class', a toggle appears in the editor. You can choose which class drives the synchronization.\n\n**2. Manual Overrides:**\n* **Coordinate Overrides:** You can type exact X/Y values in the editor header. These represent the deviation from the rule-based anchor snap point.\n* **Unlinking:** If one specific pair needs unique positioning (an exception), click the **Broken Link** icon to break the sync with its class.\n* **Rule Stacking:** In the 'By Rule' view, stacked cards indicate that one edit affects multiple sibling pairs automatically.",
  "helpRulesTitle": "Advanced Rules & Manual FEA",
  "helpRulesContent": "The **Rules** workspace provides control over the font's internal OpenType logic.\n\n* **Lookup Execution Order:** OpenType features are processed **top-down**. Use the Up/Down arrows in the Lookups pane to reorder them. This is critical for chaining substitutions (e.g., substituting 'a' to 'b' before 'b' is checked for a ligature).\n* **Group Syntax:** The editor uses specific prefixes for different types of sets:\n    * **$ (Character Sets):** Refers to auto-generated sets from your project structure (e.g., `$vowels`).\n    * **@ (Manual Groups):** Refers to custom groups you build yourself in the Groups pane (e.g., `@my_viramas`).\n* **Manual FEA Editor:** Write raw OpenType Feature (FEA) code. **Warning:** Reverting to GUI will discard manual code changes.",
  "helpKerningTitle": "Kerning (Visual Spacing)",
  "helpKerningContent": "Kerning adjusts the horizontal gap between specific pairs of letters for visual balance.\n\n* **Auto-Kern:** Let the engine calculate spacing based on the glyph shapes.\n* **X-Distance:** In the editor, hover over the gap to see the green 'x-dist' line. This represents the absolute closest gap between two characters. Input a number here to snap the spacing precisely regardless of side bearings.\n* **Debugger:** Enable 'Debug Kerning Bounding Boxes' in Settings to see the **Blue (Ascender)**, **Green (X-Height)**, and **Red (Descender)** zones used for calculations.",
  "helpCreatorTitle": "Creator Studio",
  "helpCreatorContent": "Use the purple **Create** button to turn your font into artwork or stickers.\n\n* **Interactivity:** You can **click and drag the text** directly on the canvas to position it perfectly.\n* **Customization:** Add background images, adjust shadows, and use the 'Dimmer' overlay for better readability.",
  "helpProjectManagementTitle": "Project Management & Interop",
  "helpProjectManagementContent": "**1. Importing Glyphs:**\n* Merge work from other project files or recent projects via the 'More' menu. You can choose to overwrite existing drawings or only fill in empty slots. \n\n**2. Guide Fonts:**\n* In Settings, you can link a `.ttf` file via URL (e.g., from a GitHub repo) to act as a tracing guide. Tip: Google Fonts GitHub URLs are excellent for this.\n\n**3. Snapshots:**\n* The app keeps up to **5 local snapshots** per project. Use 'Restore Snapshot' in the 'More' menu if you need to roll back changes after a major edit.",
  "helpSettingsTitle": "Settings & PUA Logic",
  "helpSettingsContent": "* **Private Use Area (PUA):** If you create a custom glyph without a standard Unicode (like a unique ligature), Aksharajanani automatically assigns it a code in the **PUA (starting at U+E000)** so it remains functional.\n* **Export Template:** Located in the 'More' menu. This saves your project's structure (sets, groups, and rules) but **strips away all drawings**. Ideal for sharing font 'skeletons'.",
